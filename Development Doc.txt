Scaffold generation:

Read Chapter 6 and did the basic creation of a new rails app and set up my data base

	made the suggested change to my 20111018195858_create_products.rb(Music_Store/db/migrate)
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :artist
      t.string :album
      t.text :description
      t.string :image_url
      t.decimal :price, precision => 8, :scale => 2

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
  def self.down
      drop_table :products		*****investigate this option when development progresses. 
  end
end

                            :image_url    => "zzz.jpg")
  product.price = -1
  assert product.invalid?
  assert_equal "must be greater than or equal to 0.01",
    product.errors[:price].join('; ')
                             
   product.price = 0 
    assert product.invalid?
    assert_equal "must be greater than or equal to 0.01",
